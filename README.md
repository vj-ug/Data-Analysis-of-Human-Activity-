The “Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset” consists of recordings from 30 participants over specified time wearing a Samsung device on their waist. Outliers were removed. 
 7352 observations with 563 variables. 

Accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix ‘t’ to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. 
The acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ).
